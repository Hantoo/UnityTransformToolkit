# UnityTransformToolkit
   
A custom transform toolkit made by Joel.   
When selecting any object, the selection order *DOES* matter. There is a handy little button called "Select All Children In Hierarchy" which will select the child objects in the parent selected in the order that it sits in the inspector hierarchy.   
   
### Move   
With the toolkit "Active" you are able to move each item within the selection individually. If you have a selection and Disable the toolkit then you are able to move the entire group together.
